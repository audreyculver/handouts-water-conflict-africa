SESYNC summer institute project on water insecurity and conflict in Africa

Hi! We are Audrey Smith and Carly Muir and our team- Water-Conflict-Africa- is part of a sesync Pursuit project researching water scarcity/insecurity and conflict in Africa. For our mini-project, we will be investigating land/water grabs (large-scale land transactions) and conflict in Africa by analzying various datasets.

We are PhD students in the Department of Geography at the University of Florida working on an NSF coupled human and natural systems project on large-scale land transactions in Ethiopia as part of our respective dissertation research.
