<b> Background </b>:
* LSLAs, also termed land grabs, are the sale or lease of land and water resources by poor, less developed countries to mostly transnational agri-industrial companies for commercialized agriculture, which are often based in economically rich countries


Research Questions:

This project investigates the co-occurrence of large-scale land acquisitions- land/water grabs- and conflict in Africa. We ask the following research questions: 

1) Where are the hotspots of LSLAs and conflict events across the African continent? 

2) Do LSLA and conflict hotspots spatially and temporally co-occur- i.e., do we find significant clusters of both conflict and LSLAs at a) the continental scale, b) the regional scale, and c) within watershed boundaries? 

Summer Institute Project Goals:

1) Clean data for analysis: conflict events & LSLAs
2) Create and run code for hotspot analysis of conflict events and LSLAs independently
3) Produce summary statistics
4) Produce hotspot maps 

Datasets:  

1) Conflict events: ACLED; UPSALA
2) Land/water grabs (LSLAs): Land 
3) African country national boundaries shapefile
4) African continent watersheds shapefile
